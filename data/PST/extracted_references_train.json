Results are shown in Table 5. Indri and Galago-SDM are two unsupervised baselines. RankSVM, Coor-Ascent, and DRMM+SDM are supervised baselines. ey used in-domain training with cross-validation, because their parameters can be learned with TREC-scale training labels. DRMM+SDM is a variant of DRMM that uses Galago-SDM score as an additional feature; it showed higher performance than the standard DRMMM. Conv-KNRM and K-NRM were both trained using domain adaption. We also examined Conv-KNRM-exact which only uses exact-matches of n-grams, e.g. 'world cup' can only be matched to 'world cup'. As shown in Table 5, K-NRM was not able to beat DRMM+SDM, meaning that the e ectiveness of unigram level so matches was weakened by domain di erences. Conv-KNRM-exact performed about the same, and was weaker than learning-to-rank approaches",

        "Abstract-Semantic segmentation of remote sensing images plays an important role in land resource management, yield estimation, and economic assessment. U-Net is a sophisticated encoder-decoder architecture which has been frequently used in medical image segmentation and has attained prominent performance. And asymmetric convolution block can enhance the square convolution kernels using asymmetric convolutions. In this paper, based on U-Net and asymmetric convolution block, we incorporate multi-scale features generated by different layers of U-Net and design a multi-scale skip connected architecture, MACU-Net, for semantic segmentation using high-resolution remote sensing images. Our design has the following advantages: (1) The multi-scale skip connections combine and realign semantic features contained both in low-level and high-level feature maps with different scales; (2) the asymmetric convolution block strengthens the representational capacity of a standard convolution layer. Experiments conducted on two remote sensing image datasets captured by separate satellites demonstrate that the performance of our MACU-Net transcends the U-Net, SegNet, DeepLab V3+, and other baseline algorithms",
